			To work with Databases
		we need to perform below operations (CRUD)

		1. select the data
		2. select with filter
		3. Select with sort
		4. Select with calcualtion
		5. select with 2, 3 and 4
		6. select with aggregation (sum, min, max, count, avg)
		7. select with grouping
		8. Insert
		9. update	
		10. delete
		11. execute stored proc (in case of databases)
		12. perform transactions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		When it comes to databaes - ADO.net was 1 of the best and fastest option
		but it is to lenghty and lots of codeing, not faster development, and not standard

		we now have have a design pattern which is common in all the framework(.Net, java, PHP, Node)
					ORM - Object Relation Mapping

		in an application, it will have POCO classes  (Plain C# objects) in .net

			application will have a class mapped to table in a database
		
	in .Net we have a seperate runtime for the same called - EntityFramework
