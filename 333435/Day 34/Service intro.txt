Angular
	SPA - routing
	components
	pipes
	services


	1. services are used for communication between components
	2. Store data and functions in a central location, so that it can be used by multiple components
		eg.in an shopping
		KidsComponent
		MaleComponent
		FemaleComponent
		OffersComponent

		all this component will need some functionality in common 
		i.e calculate discount / apply discount coupoun

		they will need to work with data which will come from rest api service
		Thus they all need communication with REST Api

		in a service class, we can make a call and get all the data in 1 shot
		and then distribute them to various components
		This will make only 1 interaction with server, rather than 4 interactions for 4 components



-----------------------------------------------------cd 
1. create a new application - ngServiceDemo
2. in the app folder, create new below folders
		components
		pipes
		services
3. in the component folder, create 2 components
	MaleProducts
	FemaleProducts
4. configure them in route.ts
5. add the router links

6. create a new service - greetser in service folder
	ng g s greetser
7. in greetser.ts - add a variable and a function
		
  greetMessage:string = "Hello I am a message from Service";
  sayHello()
  {
    return "Hello From Service Function";
  }
8. we now want to test them in both the componets we have

9. in the maleproducts.component.ts file

--------------------
	make rest api calls

1. create a new applicatin ngRESTCalls
2. create below folder in app
	component
		add a component products
	service
		add a service productsset
		

3. we will get the data from 
	https://fakestoreapi.com/products

4. in the service class, we will use HttpClient to get the data
	a. create a variable of HttpClient type and inject it in constructor
		
		_http:HttpClient;

  		constructor(httpREf:HttpClient){
    			this._http = httpREf;
  		 }

		this will import HttpClient on top of the file
		import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

5. let us make the call
	a. create a variable 
	b. write a function to make the call

	productsData:any;

  	 getProductsData()
   	{
    		let url = 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products';

     		this._http.get(url).subscribe( data =>{
    	        this.productsData = data;
      })

   }

6. in app.config.ts we have include provideHttpClient() in the provide section
		providers: [provideRouter(routes),provideHttpClient()] 
		line 8

7. we need to include in product.component.ts - a new vaiable of service class with DI and CommonModule in import

	
    _prodService:ProductsserService;

    constructor(prodSerREF:ProductsserService)
    {
      this._prodService = prodSerREF;
    }


8. let us display the data, we will call the function on click of the button (last example we called the function inside the constructor)

	in product.component.html

	<h2> Display Products </h2>



<button (click)="_prodService.getProductsData()" > Get Data </button>


<table border="1">
    <tr *ngFor="let p of _prodService.productsData"> 
        <td> {{ p.id }} </td>
        <td> {{ p.title }} </td>
        <td> {{ p.price }} </td>
        <td> {{ p.description }} </td>
    </tr>
</table>
