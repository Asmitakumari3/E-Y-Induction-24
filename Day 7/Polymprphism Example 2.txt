We need to work on Leave policy for employees
	We have a parent class - EmployeeInfo
		which will have a property - availableLeave
		everybody gets 30 leavs in a year - default
		Employees can apply for leave by passing number of days
		We have 3 child classes - applyLeave(days)
			Manager - can apply max 4 days at a strech 
			Developer - can apply max 7 days at a strech 
			Sales - can apply max 2 days at a strech 

	1. Create a new project - EmployeeManagement_OOPS	
	2. Add a new class EmployeeInfo - This will be an Abstract class
	3. Add a property - availableLeaves
	4. Add a method - applyLeaves(int days) - 

	check a condition that id days is less than 1 - throw new  Exception("Minimum 1 day of leave can be approved")

	5. Add 3 classes 
		Manager
		Developer
		Sales

	6.Inherit all this classes from EmployeeInfo

	we will override applyLeaves(days)


	7. Mark applyLeave method as virtual in parent class
	8. Mark applyLeave method as override in child classes

			{
				Age = p_age;
				InsuranceValue = p_insuranceValue;
			}


			HealthInsurance hInsr = new HealthInsurance(22,800000);
	hInsr.CalculateRenewalPremieum(age,insurancevalue);  -- this will return you a value you will						pay to insurance company - 2,40,000 

			LifeInsurance lInstr = new LifeInsurance();
