out of this 15 columns 

only first 4 columns needs to be shared with Ankun, Ashmita, Prantap, Keerthana

	how will you share 
	select col1, col2, col3, col4 from empInfo  -- you get your data
			paste it into a new file - and share the file



only first 7 columns needs to be shared with Husain, Prayas, Nikhil, Anwesha
	
only first 3 columns and last 4 colmns needs to be shares with Ravi, Noor, NikhilTrainer

only first 2 colmns, col8,9 and 15 needs to be shared with your manager

	1. You will end up createing many files (Tables)
	2. Storage will be consumed
	3. You will have to Manually sync all the files (which will take lot of time)
		This is still fine it they are files, but if it is table, it is not possible

Thus to solve this problem, we have a concept of View
	1. you can keep on creating as many views you want, 
		when someone tries to access the data useing view, at runtime, in memory a new table
		structure gets created based on your defination while createing the view and data is then 		shared
	2. It is not physically going to take space in memory
	3. it will auto update itself
	
	if you give access to table(storage) there is a risk some one may corrupt it 
	thus a safe solution for a developer is to create a view and share the same
