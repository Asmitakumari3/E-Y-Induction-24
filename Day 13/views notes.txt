Table

Views -- this is a virtual table
	1. when you have many columns in a table (single table or likned tables) and you do not wish to 		share
		all the columns with the user, you create views
		Eg. Emp table has 10 columns 
	
empNo, empName, empDesignation, empSalary, empIsPermenant, empDept, deptName, deptCity, deptHOD, deptEmail

	We wish to share some column data only to end user, not everything

	Thus you create a view

	2. When you want to display lots of calculation, but dont want to store it as a table you can use 		view

	Eg.
	you want to share EmpNo, empDesignation, empSalary, empBonus, empTravelAllowance


		create view v_empDetails
		as
		DQL statement

		create view v_empDetails
		as
		select empNo as [Employee Number],
		       empName as Name
		       empDesignation as Designation,
		       empSalary as Salary,
		       empSalary * 12 as [Annual Package],
		       (empSalary * 12) * 0.1 as Bonus
		from EmployeeInfo

		Share the view name with other user (frontend developer, junior developer)
		select * from v_empDetails

			In a view, you can have joins, functions, calculations, clauses like orderby,groupby,
