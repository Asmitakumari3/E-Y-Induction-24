1. C#
2. .Net Framework vs .Net core
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	C - just 32 keywords
	C++ - with OOPS support and much better way of programming
	C++ - C#

-------------
		.Net framework 
			Framework = BCL (Base class library) + CLR (Common Language Runtime) + Tools (SDK)

		For development you need - .net framework SDK(software development kit)
		For customers - .net runtime BCL (Base class library) + CLR (Common Language Runtime)
			
			Common Language runtime is responsible for running your application 
				Security
				Threads
				Garbage collection 
				JIT - Just in time compilation 
				Code Conversion 
				+++ +++ +++
				C - C++ .exe will contain - binary code - which will directly execute on ur 					machine
				but in .net
			When you compile a .net code - .exe contains MSIL code 
				(Microsoft intermediate language code) - like Byte code in Java
			when you run the application, code needs to be converted into binary again as per OS
				JIT will do it at runtime
				

			.Net framework was mostly for windows OS (2002 till 2016)
			

		.Net core is now open source and is availble for all the OS
		Develop anywhere - use anywhere

			improvised further - support to develop cloud based application
