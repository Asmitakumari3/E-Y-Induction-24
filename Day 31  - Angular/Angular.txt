				Angular
--This is a  client side web development framework (.net was for server side development)
--This is a framework by Google
--Development is done using
	HTML
	CSS
	Typescript
--Best framework for createing SPA application 
	SPA - Single Paged Application 
		SPA will download all the pages, files, images on the clients browser 
		and when you want to browse it again it will not go to server, like an app

		only go back to the server to refresh the data

	This saves a lot of communication (round-trip between client and server)

	in todays world this is the need, only the urls and rest of the things are centralized
	(refere the image file)
--Softwares
	it runs on NodeJS, it needs nodejS to be running
	we can use any IDE for development, visual studio, eclipse, or Visual studio code							(this is lightweight and mostly used)

	

-- it can be used inside server side web development technologies as well like inside ASP.Net MVC	

-- Angular Development needs good understanding on below topics 
		Component development (HTML + CSS + Typescript)
			Pipes
			Directives
		REST API Calls (HttpClient) 
		Routing (SPA)
			This are 80% of angular

--Angular is based on Component Development Methadology - everything is a component
		component (HTML+CSS+TS+.spec.ts) is like a plug in or extention on browser
			which can be removed or added anytime you want to 


in .ts file
			we write, variables, functions, constructor, this is a class file
in .html file, we write HTML, to display varaiables and call methods written in .ts file
in .css file, we write css which gets applied on HTML
in .spec.ts - we write test cases (unit test)
