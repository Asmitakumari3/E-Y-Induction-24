You should not create object of 1 class in another class

		public class HR
		{
			Manager mgr = new Manager(); //this will create problem in memory
						     //if you do not release this object from 							     //	memory

							//performance issues
							//memory leak
							//over utilization of memory
							//heavy object just lying on RAM when 
							 //they are not even used
		}

		instead we should leave this task on Runtime - .net core
				.net core will create the object and destroy the object
				once use is been done
			
			This is feature of runtime which is now availabe in every framework
			.net, Java, angular, react, node etcc...

			Developer should not create any object, leave it onto the runtime
			you will just have to program bit differently
			(we call this feature as Inversion control / Dependency Injection)
