Learn SQL as a Language (this is language is common for SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySql) any 				RDBMS system- it is also a standard

		You can connect to sql server and work with data,(create, search, edit, delete, update) useing sql language

				1. DDL 
					Crete (any object)
					alter (edit any object - not data - OBJECT)
					drop the object

			
				create object objectname()

				create table tablename( column names)
				create database databasename
				create view viewname (...)
				create procedure procedurename (...)
				create function functionname (...)

					empNo int,  (primary key, default values)
					empName varchar(20),
					empDesignation varchar(20),
					empSalary int,
					empIsPermenat bit,

					constraints list

				constraints are used for data integrity/ data validation
				eg. designation can be only Manager, Developer and HR
				    salary to between 5000 and 25000 only
				    empIsPermenant is mandatory field, canno be left blank

				There are 5 types of constraints
		1.Primary key (this is make sure every record has an identity and is unique)
		2.Check Constraint (check for data, eg, designation, salary,name char length etc..)
		3. NOT NULL (means mandatory)
		4. Unique key (means the column will always have unique value, eg email, pan,aadhar,mobile)
		5. Foreign Key(relation with other table)
