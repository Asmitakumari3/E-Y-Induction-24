	This is a standard set by W3C -- 
		They have given a standard class for programming language useing 			OOPs

		C#, Java, Typescript(For Angular, React), VB
			HttpClient -- this is a standard class we use for data 						consumption
			fetch (API) - for javascript calling

		This standard allows us to make all the calls
			GET, PUT, POST and delete

		we create object of HttpClient and specify which format of data we want(JSON or xml) and make a call


Steps--

2. in the poco class, create a method to consume the data, keep return type they type of data you want
