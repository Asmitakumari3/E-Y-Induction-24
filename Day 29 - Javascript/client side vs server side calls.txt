There are 2 ways to consume RestAPI data

1. client side (scripting - JavaScript, typescript for the same)

	a.This is the fastest way to get the data to client, 
		client always wants the data as fast as possible

	b. This is a direct call to the server - and that's why it is fastest

	c. This technique should NOT be used when the data is sensitive, server address is not
		sensitive (eg. credit card info, payment gateway, login passwords, otp etc..)

		reason, when you write JavaScript, end user can view the complete code from browser

	use it for calls like, getTemperature,get currencyExchangeRate,view cricket score etc...
		
2. server side (programming - c#, java, vb, c++ etc...)
	This is the safest way to get the data, very highly secure
	little bit slower than the above 1, as client will have to come to server first and then server will go to another server and get you the data
