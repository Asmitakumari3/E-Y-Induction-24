When you fire any SQL statement on the server

insert into deptInfo values(....);

1. server will check for Authentication - r u authorised or not, are your username and password correct or not
2. if correct, it will compile the query
3. it will then check of the table is present or not, along with columns, data types
4. it will check do you have rights to perform DML operations on the same 
5. it will insert the values and return a confirmation to you 
-------------------------------------------------
		
		
	This 5 steps along with other steps server has to be performed every time it recieves the DML request
	So think about live servers, amazon, banks, airlines, clients, 1000's request coming every min
		This is a time consumeing process but also tedious 

			Thus Database server gives us an Object, which says I will perform all this steps
			once, i.e compilation, authentication, rights, roles, check for tables etc...
		and when u perform DML with this object, it will directly go to table and perform DML
				This will save time, improve performane

			Thus we use this object - procedure
		---------------------------------
		security guard is like a server
			has to check your identity
			calls up HR / manager to about u - r u a right person or no
			they will come to drop you at ur seat

			to solve this problem after checking your identity at the first time
				They issed you a ID card - thumb print which will give you direct access
		they have to do this for all the 1000 employees - it will be tedious
