Routing - is a part of web applications 
	used in ASP.Net MVC, WebAPI, (also in Angular, but has a different 						meaning and different purpose)


	A real world application has more than 1000's of endpoints
		you had created an app, which had just 3 controllers, you had almost 6-7 endpoint(action methods) in 1 controller, which makes around 18 endpoints

	think of Amazon, Netflix, Zomato

	when server has to serve, 1000's of endpoints to 100000 of users everyhour

	searching end point out of 1000's of endpoint, takes times

	which will hit the performance, and users will have to wait for response which they do not like and thus they dont want to use the app

	instead, server now can create an index of routs in memory and reach the
	endpoint 10times faster rather than searching for route
	which is a booster to performance

	This feature was newly introduced in version 4 - we are useing  7
	useage is most simple, just use proper naming conventions as per project documentation, use meaning ful names

		This is the most simple topic in web - and most powerful well


------------------------------
	create a new WebAPI app - give it name as netflixApp_Routing

	create below controllers
		Thriller
		Comic
		Horror
		Action
		Romance
		SciFic
		Hollywood
		Bollywood
		Tollywood

			add a Model class, MovieDetail
				movieId,
				movieName,
				movieCategory (Thriller,Comic,Horror,Action,Romance,SciFic),
				movieState (Hollywood,Bollywood,Tollywood)
				movieActorName,
				movieActress	

		create  static list of MovieDetails,add 30 movies in the same	

			add below methods in model
			viewAllMovies
			getMoviesByCategory
			getMoviesByState
			getMovieByName (singleMovie)
			addNewMovie
			deleteAMovie
			updateMovie

		all the controllers will have this action methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		You have consumed a WebAPI in console app
		1. create a new console, consume netflixAPI
		2. you have made a get call	
			display the movie detail by name
		3. POST a new movie to api (make a call to addNewMovie) - this is not done in past



		1. viewAllMovies
		2. getMovieByName (this is not working)
