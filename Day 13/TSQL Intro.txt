RDBMS system - there are 2 languages u work with
	SQL - u studied this
	TSQL - Transact SQL (In SQL Server)
	PLSQL - On Oracle

	We need variables, if conditions, loops, switch case, exception handling etc... programming

		There are seperate objects for them

		1. Functions - create your own functions - UDF - user defined functions
				this is used to mostly perform, 
					calculations, conditions, formatting, validations with data
	
		2. Stored Procedures in SQL Server
			(known as procedure in oracle)
			This is used for DML operations - this gives you programming abilities

		3. Triggers (as the name suggest - this are the events raised by server in background)
			eg.when a new emp is added, send an email (welcome email)
			   when a empLeaves - send an email to their team mates or manager
				

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		To create them, alter them or drop them u use the same SQL language

--Funnction structure
		create function functionname(...) returns datatype
		as
		begin
			return a value
		end

--procedure structure
		create procedure procedurename(....)
		as 
		begin

		end
