1. We want to share certain columns and data with frontend developers, client who will fetch the
	data in excel and other members needs to view the data, but we will not be shareing with them
	where the data is stored, they will not have access to storage

	1. we want to share accNo, accName, accBalance, intrest(5% of balance) as Future Balance, to someone, 		thus create a view for the same

	2. We need to share Savings account details to one of the customer, do not include any branchinfo in 		it, even branch no

	3. We need to publish report every week, where we mention, total Accounts for every branchName

			select count(accNo) as Total, branchName from accountsInfo join branchInfo
				on accountsInfo.branchNo = branchInfo.branchNo
				group by  branchName

	4. Shaare the name and account no of the all the ppl who has balance less than 5000

		insert a new value in firstview -- see what error you will get
