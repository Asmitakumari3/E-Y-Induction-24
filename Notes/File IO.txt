		Topic Name : FileIO (File Input output)

			We need to use a namespace/library/package
		useing System.IO on top (this will make available all the methods, properties related
						to file input and output)

			We have 3 types (class)

			FileStream (this is used to create, open, override the file)
			FileWriter (this will allow you to write to a file)
			FileReader (this will allow you to read from a file)
