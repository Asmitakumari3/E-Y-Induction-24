In the same database

1. create a table, emplooyeeInfo
	empno, empName, empDesignation, empSalary, empIsPermenant

2. create a procedure proc_HR
	where hr should be able to 
		add a new employee
		update an employee (change designation, and empisPermenant or no)
		delete an employee
		promote an employee (change the salary, make sure new salary is higher than current one
					else print an error message)

	








Types of procedure - based on parameters

Procedure with
a. In - input parameter (where user will pass the input, eg. @accNo, @amt, etc......)
	can be mandatory or can be default
	

b. without parameter - do not take parameters from users
	eg. new_flightProc
	create procedure newFlight
	as
	begin
		--we did our operations here - like insert 9x records
	end

c. with out parameter (here, procedure will give you an output) - value
		it is like a return (which functions also does)
			but function can return only 1 value
			proc can return multiple values useing out parameter

	--let us see how 

	create procedure newAccNo(@accNo int out, --it means, user will not provide input, but proc will
						  --tell me the new accNo

	if you want procedure to calculate some value for you and return that value back to you, you can declare it as a parameter with out keyout

	in our example, user will pass accname, accType and accbalance, 
		table also needs accNo, but to open a new account, how can user pass accNo

		as accNo is supposed to be an auto generated value, so we generated the value inside
		proc - useing max(accNo) + 1 


		and then we want that new accno to be returned back to user (who executed the proc)


	1. Procedure can have mulitple output parameters
	2. procedures can return multiple values useing output parameter
		where as functions can return only 1 value
				
	3. Proceure parameter as by default input, if you want to have to declare/use out keyword
	4. parameter can act as both input and output as well, this is mostly in case if you want to format the input eg. phoneno
