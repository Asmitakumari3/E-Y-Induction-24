WebAPI Review

1. What is WebAPI - it is all about shareing the data endpoints to customers, clients, internal team without shareing the data access

2. WebAPI is an implementation of REST services 
	REST - Representational State Transfer - (transfer of data) - from client to server and server to clie
3. Create a new application in .net core and C# as a language

4. We can share any data from any data source (Collection, primitive data, data base, files etc..)

5. WebAPi supports all the HttpVerbs for data (HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPost, HttpDelete)

6. We use IActionResult for createing methods/functions to return the data as well as statuscode
	200 -OK
	201 - Accepted
	404 - Not Found

7. WebAPI will share data in JSON format (also supports XML) - if asking client says I want data in xml, IactionResult will serialize(convert) data in xml and send, bydefault it uses JSON 

8. We created first application on List of string (friends and products)
--------------------------------
	Today will have WEBAPI application on Collection of Object and use EF to perform the same on database
