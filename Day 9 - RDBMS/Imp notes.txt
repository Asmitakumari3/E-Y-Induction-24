Excel File : 8 columns

Team A: We need to share data of only first 3 columns
Team B: We need to share data of last 4 columns
Team C: We need to share all the columns
Team D: we need to share col2, col3, and col7

---------------------------------------
			Normalization - is a process we use to Design a database
				what columns should be considered
				what columns will go in another table
				How do you break the tables 	
				How do you relate the tables
				How do you make sure to overcome problems from flat file
			there are 6 states of Normalization
			1NF
			2NF
			3NF
			4NF
			5NF
			6NF

		For RDBMS - Databases - we use first 3
		For DataAnalytics - we use the last 3 (also called as DeNormalization) - data science, data
											analytics, data 											forcasting

		once we do 1NF, 2NF and 3rdNF we create diagrams - ER diagrams
