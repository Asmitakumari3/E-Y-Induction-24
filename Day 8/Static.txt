1. Create a new application - Static Example
2. Create a new class - EmployeeInfo
3. Create properties
	empNo, empName, empDesignation
4. Create a constructor to accept all this 3 values
5. create 3 objects of EmployeeInfo with all the values been taken from user


	in the same program, empno should not just be just number, 
		it should be First 2 characters of designation and num

		HR101
		MA102
		SA103
		MA104
		DE105
		AC106

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We now have 3 subclasses, and for empNo we have different sequence

	HR empNo - should be HR101, HR102, HR103.....
	Manager empNo - should be MA501, MA502, MA503 .......
	Developer empNo - should be DEV901, DEV902,DEV903 



	Thus add 3 classes, HR, Manager, Developer
		inherit all of them from EmployeeInfo
		mark EmployeeInfo as Abstract
