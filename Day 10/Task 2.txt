Drop all the databases you have created since morning

1. create a new database - BankingDB_Practice
2. in the BankingDB_Practice
	create below tables

	1. BranchInfo
		branchNo int primary key, 10,20,30, 40 
		branchName varchar(20) -- name of some area - eg. SaltLake, Rasberry, Hi-tech city, Cuff Pared
		branchCity varchar(20) --                     Kolkatta, Kolkatta, Hyderabad, Mumbai etc...
		branchEmail varchar(20) 
			all the columns are not null


		Open 5 branches (10 to 50) -- insert 5 records

	we will customers in branches, an bank can have customers only in the branches, not loose or customer from home (like WFH

	Thus we need a table to store customer details mapped to branches

	so create below table

	2. CustomerInfo
		customerNo int primary key and identity
		customerName varchar(20)
		accountType varchar(20) - allow only Savings, Current and PF
		accountBalance bigint - do not allow negative value
		branchNo -- this is a foreign key to BranchInfo table
			(in this column you can insert only values which are present in branchInfo table)
	add 15 customer to bank, 3 customers per branch
