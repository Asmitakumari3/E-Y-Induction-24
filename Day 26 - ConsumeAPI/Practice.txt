Practice
Make a HttpClient - RestAPI call to 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
https://fakestoreapi.com/products

-----
Task - till 11:30
make a call to below url

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/id ( 1 to 100)

first make a call with hardcoded id
later take id from user and display the post

Make a get call to :
https://fakestoreapi.com/products/id-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
heard or saw below error 
	CORS - Cross Origin Resource Shareing ?

all the calls you made above is free for testing - they are not real world data, 
	same url for learning

	if someone gets the url - they can make a call easily and get the data

	and can misuse the data

	Thus the webapi - application does not allow to get the data to any application - unless and untill it is made available for that appliation 

	Thus when you create a webapi application and share the endpoints with them they will not be able to make a call, it will show an error (CORS)
	we need to learn how do we allow them to consume our data by configuring CORS
-----------------------------------------------
	1. create a new WebAIP applicatin - CORS_BankingAPI
		use EF core to give the accountsinfo data

	2. create a console application, make a call to accountsinfo endpoint
		we will get an CORS error, which we will learn to fix
