1. we have a database - empDB_dataAnnotation - which has empInfo table, we will use this, this table has a lot of constraint

2. we will create a new MVC web app - to understand, Data annotation more clearly

3. enable EF in the project by adding 4 nuget packages

4. download poco classes

5. add a new controller - MVC controller with EF
	this will create views for us on empInfo
		List of employees(Index.cshtml)
			add
			update
			delete

	this will want to use DI by default, halfly configured and half we have to 
	we added DBContext class as scoped

6. in the view/shared folder, you will find a file called, layout.cshtml
	copy line 25,26 and 27, paste it, change the name of asp-controller to name of your controller and lable and default action name(viewname)

7. run the application test the application, 
	we tested  by inserting wrong values for all constraints, in 
		add, edit page

8. we also noticed name of columns are printed by default on all the pages
	this is not presentatable

9. thus we will use data annotation in Poco class and fix the above problems	
	(constraints and presentation of columns)
