DQL and JOIN - we will write almost 50 queries - 50-80 commands

1. Create a new database BankingDB_SQL
2. Create a table BranchInfo
	branchNo, branchName, branchCity
		branchNo primary key
		BranchName will be unique
		branchCity and branchName will be not null 

	branchCity is Mumbai, Kolkatta and Pune only 

	add 2 branches to the table for every city (10,20,30....)

	select * from branchInfo

3. Modify the constraint to also include Chennai and Bangalore

	do not add any branches here as of now

4. Create a tables AccountsInfo
	accNo primary key - identity (500 and increase it by 1)
	accName - min 3 characters - not null
	accType - only Savings, Current and PF(mandatory field)
	accBalance - min 100 and max 10,00,000
	accIsActive - bit - mandatory
	accBranch - foreign key
	
	add 20 valid records - (no abcd, xyz)


		alter table tablesName
		alter column colname datatype

	add 5 more records, keep accBranch null this time

	alter table accountInfo
	alter column accBranch int null

5. select all the data from accounts
6. select accNo, accName and Accbalance from accountsInfo
7. select only Savings accounts from accountsInfo
8. select only savings and PF accounts from accountsInfo
9. select only Savings account who has accBalance more than 1,00,000
10. select only accounts whoes name starts with 'N'
	select * from accountsInfo where accName like 'N%'
	select * from accountsInfo where substring(accName,1,1) = 'N'

11. select all the accounts data sorted by AccountType
12. select all the accounts data sorted by AccountType and all the name to be internally sorted by 		 accountTypes
13. select all the accounts data sorted by AccountType and all the name to be internally sorted by 	accountNumber
14. Display maximum balance available in accountsInfo along with accno, name and type
	select accNo, accName, accBalance as [Avail Balance] from accountsInfo where accBalance =(select max(accBalance) from accountsInfo)

15. Display total Accounts haveing balance less than 50,000
16. Display total accounts for every account type
	select count(accNo), accType from accountsInfo group by accType
	select count(accType), accType from accountsInfo group by accType
	select count(accBalance), accType from accountsInfo group by accType
		



17. select data from both the tables haveing accountNo 105 (or any1 accNo from your accounts table)
18. select accNo, accName, accBranchName and accountCity with balance more than 50000
19. select accounts which are not mapped to any branch
