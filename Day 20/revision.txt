1. for every linq query (from any source) -- below is the format

	var variableName = from pointerVariable in source	
			    select pointerVariable;
	
	eg.
	var acc = from a in db.accountInfoes
		  select a;

	//write a foreach loop and iterate through acc 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We will want to display the below details

1. display all the accounts from accounts table
	var acc = from a in db.accountInfoes
		  select a;

2. display all the branches from branchInfo table
	var branches = from b in db.branchInfoes
			select b;

3. display all the accounts from accounts table which are Savings type
	var accSavings = from a in db.accountsInfos
			 where a.accType == "Savings"
			 select a;
4.display all the accounts from accounts table which are inactive
	var accPermenat = from a in db.accountsInfo
			   where a.accIsActive == 0
		          select a;

5. display all the accounts from accounts table which are of type PF and inactive
	var accPF_In = from a in db.accountinfoes
			where a.accType == "PF" && a.accIsActive == false
			select a; (|| for or)

6. display all the accounts from accounts table, display the data in order of Name (A-Z)
	var accName = from a in db.accountInfoes
		      order by a.accName
		      select a;
7. display all the accounts from account table, which has balance more than 25000 only, display in order or 			balance haveing higher balance on top

	var accountFiler = from a in db.accountInfoes
			  where a.accBalance > 25000
			 order by a.accBalance descinding
			select a;
8. display total of all the account balance
	var total = (from a in db.accountInfoes 
			select a.accBalance).Sum();

	var total = from a in db.accountsInfoes
			select new { total_balance = a.sum(a => a.accBalance) }  //old syntax LAMBDA express

9. display total Inactive accounts
	var inactive = (from a in db.accountsInfoes			
			where a.accIsActive == "false"
			select a.accIsActive).count();

10. we want to display accName as Name, 
	       accBalance as AvailableBalance 
	       10% of accBalance as Intrest from account table

	var acc = from a in db.accountInfoes
			select new 
			{
				Name = a.accName, 
				AvailableBalance = a.accBalance, 
				Intrest = a.accBalance * 0.1
			};


11. JOIN data from both tables and display
	display accName, accType, accBalance, branchNo, branchName, branchLocation

	var accDetails = from a in db.accountsInfoes
			  join db.branchInfoes
			 on
